# Berlin Functional Programming Group

## Book Club

We will choose a book to read and meet regularly to discuss its contents and present mini-projects based on what we are learning. A decent model for this group is the [London Computation Club](http://london.computation.club/).

The following books have been proposed for the book club (submit a pull request to add others):

- Tom Stuart. [_Understanding Computation_](http://computationbook.com/)
- Benjamin Pierce, et al. [_Software Foundations_](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html)
- Edwin Brady. [_Type-Driven Development with Idris_](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris)
- Phil Freeman. [_PureScript by Example_](https://leanpub.com/purescript/)
- Richard Bird. [_Thinking Functionally with Haskell_](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/books/functional/)
- Richard Bird and Oege De Moor. [_The Algebra of Programming_](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Programming-Prentice-Hall-International-Computer/dp/013507245X)
- Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck. [_The Haskell Road to Logic, Math and Programming_](https://fldit-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/~peter/PS07/HR.pdf)
